# 1. Introduction

RIstanbulCafeMenu is a cloud-based QR digital menu platform developed to modernize menu management within the hospitality industry.

The system eliminates printed menus and replaces them with a centralized, real-time managed web application powered by Firebase infrastructure.

Customers scan a QR code and instantly access the live menu through their browser.  
No installation, no app dependency, no manual updates.

This project demonstrates structured frontend architecture, scalable NoSQL modeling, and serverless deployment principles.
